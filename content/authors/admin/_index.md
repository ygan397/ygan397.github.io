      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Yu Gan is a senior research engineer at [SystemResearch@Google](https://techsysinfra.google/research/), working on efficient LLM serving and coding agents. He received his Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL)](https://www.csl.cornell.edu/), [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), advised by Professor [Christina Delimitrou](https://people.csail.mit.edu/delimitrou/Main.html). His Ph.D. thesis was focused on building and managing large-scale microservices in datacenters, improving their performance and resource efficiency using machine learning. He is currently broadly interested in ML for systems and systems for ML. Before studying at Cornell, he obtained my B.Eng. degree in Electronic Engineering from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in 2016. 

Yu Gan has been recived three IEEE Micro TopPicks Awards and one CIDR best paper award.
